##MVP:

  As a player, I would like to see the title of the game on the page, so I know what the game is.

  As a player, I would like to see the images of the cards I click on, so I know if I matched the cards.

  As a player, I would like to see the cards kept face up if I matched, so that I know what cards I should not click on again.

  As a player, I would like to see something when the game is over or I have completed the board, because it provides for completion.

  As a player, I would like to only see the images on the cards when I click on them, so that the game isn't played for me.

  As a player, I would like only be able to click on a maximum of 2 cards, so that I can play another turn.

  As a player, if the images don't match, the cards should only stay revealed for a max of 10 seconds, before being hidden again, so that those cards can be played again.


##Icebox:

  As a player, I would like to see a 'score' to see how many attempts I have made thus far, so that I can see progress.

  As a player, I would like to win or unlock a prize once the board is complete, because it provides incentive.

  As a player, I would like to get feedback on what to do next once I have completed the board, so that I know how to get or unlock my prize.

  As the card dealer, I would like to know your name, so I can personalize messages to the player.

  As a player, I would like to see my messages personalized with my name, so I feel special.
