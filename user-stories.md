##MVP:

  As a player, I would like to see the images of the cards I click on, so I know if I matched the cards.

  As a player, I would like to see the cards kept face up if I matched, so that I know what cards I should not click on again.

  As a player, I would like to see something when the game is over or I have completed the board, because it provides for completion.




##Icebox:

  As a player, I would like to see a 'score' to see how many attempts I have made thus far, so that I can see progress.

  As a player, I would like to win or unlock a prize once the board is complete, because it provides incentive.

  As a player, I would like to get feedback on what to do next once I have completed the board, so that I know how to get or unlock my prize.
